# Clay CS

This is a simple (mostly autogenerated) C# wrapper for the clay library.  
I uploaded it for people who want to adapt it, or learn from it. However it will not be updated, and i will not provide support for it.

## Usage

### Building
If you want to compile from scratch, there is a swig file in Clay/Native, that you can compile with swig, and then with a C++ compiler.

### Using
You can use the ClayHelpers.cs and Clay.cs files to interact with the clay library. (see ClayTest/Program.cs for an example)

### Updating
To update the clay bindings, simply replace clay.h. If nothing breaking has changed, you should be able to just recompile the swig.i file.

### Notes
The Clay.cs file holds the macros, that could not be autogenerated by swig, unfortunately they had to be changed a little.
