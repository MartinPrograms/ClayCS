# Clay Renderer Raylib

This is a simple renderer for clay, that uses raylib as a backend. It is almost a 1:1 mapping of the example code in the clay repository, but with C#.  
At this moment the RaylibExtensions.Raylib_MeasureText function behaves weirdly, and i'm not sure why, and i couldn't solve it.
