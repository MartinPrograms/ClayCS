The build.bat file is a simple batch file that compiles the swig.i file, into a cpp file and opens it in windows explorer.  
To compile it i've been using the SLN file in the VS22 directory, and then copying the resulting dll to the output directory of whatever project i'm working on.  
I've included a prebuilt dll in this directory, but it may not work on your system, so i recommend building it yourself.  

For any other platforms other than windows, you'll have to compile the swig.i file yourself, and link it to the resulting .so file.  


To update the clay bindings, simply replace clay.h. If nothing breaking has changed, you should be able to just recompile the swig.i file.  
The swig file also includes *many* important functions, that could not be autogenerated by swig. It is vital that these do not change, unless you know what you're doing.  

okay well that's it.
